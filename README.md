# Surfs_Up
# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to gather the temperature statistics for June and December to determine if opening a surf shop in Hawaii will be viable throughout the entire year. We ran queries to retrieve data from out database, one for the month of June and the other for the month of December. We converted the queries into data frames, then used the data frame to retrieve the descriptive statistics. 

## Results
- June and Decembers average temperatures are very close. June has an average of 75 degrees and December's average is 71.
- June has a max temperature of 85 degrees, and December has a max of 83 degrees. 
- Junes minimum temperature is 64 degrees and December's minimum temperature is 56.

## Summary
From our analysis, we can conclude that there is not much of a fluctuation in temperature throughout the year. The temperature seems to be very consistent even throughout the winter months. To get a better understanding and analysis. I would perform two additional queries on the precipitation between the two months, December and June.
